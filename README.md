# Shortest-Path
Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm implementation by Autocad R9, Autolisp

On 1994, When I learned the AI and Principles of Design Automation in the university, I decided to implement the Shortest path problem as my agenda in the seminar of the class.
At that time, I did not know there were many algorithms to solve the Shortest path problem. So, I tried to solve the problem by trail and error. And, I did not make it.
I would like to solve the problem by applied  Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm in the same tools and envrionment as I had in 1994. During these years, I am waiting for AutoCAD Release 9 from the forbiden old DOS software website. Finally, it was released by the old-dos.ru in 2019.DEC.14.

Here it is.
